Political Animals and Animal Politics is a edited collection published by Palgrave Macmillan and edited by the green political theorists Marcel Wissenburg and David Schlosberg The work addresses the emergence of academic animal ethics informed by political philosophy as opposed to moral philosophy It was the first edited collection to be published on the topic and the first book length attempt to explore the breadth and boundaries of the literature As well as a substantial introduction by the editors it features ten sole authored chapters split over three parts respectively concerning institutional change for animals the relationship between animal ethics and ecologism and real world laws made for the benefit of animals The book contributors were Wissenburg Schlosberg Manuel Arias Maldonado Chad Flanders Christie Smith Clemens Driessen Simon Otjes Kurtis Boyer Per Anders SvÃ¤rd and Mihnea Tanasescu The focus of their individual chapters varies but recurring features include discussions of human exceptionalism exploration of ways that animal issues are or could be present in political discourse and reflections on the relationship between theory and practice in politics In part Political Animals and Animal Politics arose from a workshop that Wissenburg and Schlosberg organised at the European Consortium for Political Research Joint Sessions conference though not all attendees contributed to the volume and not all contributors presented at the workshop Footage of the workshop appeared in De Haas in de Marathon The Pacer in the Marathon a documentary about the Dutch Party for the Animals Political Animals and Animal Politics was published as part of the Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn Reviewers identified the contributions from Driessen Flanders and Boyer as of particular interest but challenged the inclusion of chapters focused on the environment They criticised the book failure to include contributions from or sufficiently engage with the work of the key voices in the politically focused animal ethics literature such as Robert Garner Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka Alasdair Cochrane Kimberly Smith or Siobhan Sullivan Wissenburg chapter was identified as the one that engaged most directly with this literature but his approach was a negative one Garner has written that Political Animals and Animal Politics should be praised for its trailblazing but predicted that it would be superseded by stronger collections on the same theme
